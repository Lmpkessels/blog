[ ] Full worked example: pick two binary numbers (e.g. 0101 (5) × 1001 (9)), show the partial products, then add them to get the final binary and decimal result.

[ ] Clear “x = 0” wording: instead of “every x becomes 0,” just say “unused positions are filled with 0s.”

[ ] Fix language slips: “AND wit A” → “AND with A,” “en up” → “end up,” “for arrays” → “four arrays.”

[ ] Figure caption clarity: call it a “step table for binary multiplication” instead of “truth table.”

[ ] Why it matters: one short line connecting back to hardware (e.g. “This is exactly how an ALU inside your CPU multiplies numbers.”).

[ ] Tie to addition logic: one-liner reminding readers that multiplication is just repeated addition at the bit level.

[ ] Closing summary: one sentence that recaps: “By combining AND, SHIFT, and ADD, we can build multiplication from the same simple gates as addition.”
