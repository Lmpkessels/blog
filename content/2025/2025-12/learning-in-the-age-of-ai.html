        <main class="post-body"><p>The world is changing <strong>lightning fast</strong>, but so can you. In today's blog, I'm going to walk you through a <strong>step-by-step process</strong> to <strong>learn fast</strong>, while also gaining a <strong>deep understanding</strong>.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: The way I learn is not shallow; information written in simplified form I use as little as possible, most often I look for fundamentals in specs, documentation, and books, to seek a fundamental understanding.</p>
<p>With that being said, let's dive into how it's done.</p>
<h2>How I leverage AI in my learning process</h2>
<p>A lot of people are <strong>scared that AI will replace their jobs</strong>, while a <strong>lot of jobs will indeed be replaced</strong>, your intellect never will. And the better you become at understanding and <strong>learning skills and knowledge</strong>, the greater your intellect will grow. This also means that you can <strong>add more value to society</strong> in the coming age.</p>
<p>Here's how I use AI in my learning process, first I keep this <strong>mental note</strong>, AI has seen patterns accross many domains, better than we humans probably can. Some people ask, <strong>'But what if AI is wrong?'</strong> Well, <strong>'what if the resource you're getting information from is wrong?'</strong> Same question, different lens.</p>
<p>So, how do I use AI in my learning process? Lets give you an example, for example am interested in Blockchain, I want to be able to build blockchain with Rust, then <strong>the question is how</strong>, herefor I go to ChatGPT and ask 'what are the core fundamentals of Rust?' then it answers me by <em>giving the core fundamentals</em> such as, Stack/Heap, Ownership, Borrowing, and the rest of the core fundamentals. After that, I ask, create a roadmap to learn these core fundamentals in the deepest way possible while only using resources such as <strong>specs</strong>, <strong>documentation</strong>, <strong>books</strong>, and <strong>very deep blogs</strong>.</p>
<p>Then I follow the roadmap of <strong>core fundamentals</strong>.</p>
<p>I have done this for multiple layers. To name a few, I built the <strong>core fundamental</strong> understanding of Rust 6 months ago, then I used those <strong>core fundamentals</strong> to build Hash Algorithms, such as SHA1/256/512, RIPEMD-160, MD4/5, and multiple other Hash Algorithms. If you want to take a look, you can <a href="https://github.com/Lmpkessels/cryptographic-algorithms">click here</a>.</p>
<p>Now you've understood how you can leverage AI in your learning process, let's take a look at the steps that I've organised.</p>
<h2>The step process in an organised manner.</h2>
<ol class="post-ul">
  <li>Define the goal</li>
  <li><b>Go to AI and ask</b>: "What are the core fundamentals I need to build a 1st principled foundation in {subject, skill, etc (use only one word)}".</li>
  <li>Ask it to build a roadmap for X amount of hours only using specs, documentations, and books (quick note: ask for the best chapters of the book, even better find a PDF of the book it just gave, then feed it to GPT and ask the question again: what are the best chapters of the book to build X understanding).</li>
  <li>Always <b>apply what you learn</b> as soon as possible, even if it breaks no matter what, put your ego aside and apply.</li>
  <li>Reflect on what you've applied. Here are <b>5 simple questions you can ask yourself</b>: (i) What did I work on? (ii) What broke before it was fixed? (iii) What did I learn from this work? (vi) What is the Why behind Closures? (iv) What is an area for improvement?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Reminder</strong>: Thanks to new technologies, we often get confused. To take a part of that away, keep asking, 'How does something make me better?' 'How will it improve society?' That makes you think of solutions.</p>
<p>Till the next one.</p></main>
