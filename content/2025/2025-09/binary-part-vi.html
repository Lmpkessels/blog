            Every electronic device that works with data -
            <strong>your PC, phone, or smart TV</strong> - uses a Central
            Processing Unit (CPU), at the heart of every CPU lies an Arithmetic
            Logic Unit (ALU).
          </p>
          <p>
            An
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              ><em>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</em></a
            >
            is a combinational digital circuit that performs arithmetic and
            bitwise operations on integer binary numbers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without the <strong>ALU</strong>, your CPU wouldn’t be able to make
            mathematical decisions. And everything inside your electronic device
            comes down to <strong>math at the bit level</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're reading <em>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) Explained</em> on
            your Phone or PC (probably not your TV), then you’re using an
            <strong>ALU</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now you know the importance of an ALU let's look at
            <strong>the components used to build an ALU</strong>.
          </p>
          <h2>The Components Used to Build an ALU</h2>
          <p>An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is built from many components:</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Including:</strong> transistors, logic gates, adders
            (half/full), ripple-carry circuits, multiplexers, control logic,
            flags, and output registers.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the <strong>ALU</strong> I built in <strong>Rust</strong> the
            following operations are used:
            <strong
              >ripple-carry addition, ripple-carry subtraction, binary
              multiplication, and long division</strong
            >, all for <strong>unsigned math (&gt; 0)</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            These operations relied on the logic gates:
            <strong>AND, NOT, OR, XOR, and Shift Left</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're not familiar with <strong>boolean logic</strong> or
            <strong>binary ADD, SUB, MULTIPLY, and DIV operations</strong> then
            you can dive deep into the concept of your choice at the
            <a href="/content/0000/math.html">Mathematics homepage</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those were the components used to build an ALU. Now, let's see how
            the ALU works.
          </p>
          <h2>How an ALU Works</h2>
          <p>
            The job of an ALU is to constantly process data — also known as bits
            — which pass through transistors. Each transistor (there are about
            25 billion in a Mac M3 chip) acts as a tiny switch (OPEN/CLOSED)
            before each gate. They work on electrons: when a small voltage is
            applied, the transistor “opens,” and when there’s no voltage, it
            “closes.”
          </p>
          <p>
            When it’s <strong>open</strong>, current can flow (representing a
            1); when it’s <strong>closed</strong>, no current flows
            (representing a 0).
          </p>
          <p>
            When the bits are received at the register, they go through logic
            gates, perform billions of arithmetical and logical calculations in
            milliseconds, and form n-bit words. Those n-bit words are then sent
            to the output register and stored at the right address in RAM, so
            you can see the right patterns on your screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those patterns can be characters, digits, symbols, shapes, motion,
            and colors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then we have <strong>opcode</strong> (control logic). These are
            patterns of bits, for example,
            <strong>a 6-bit opcode gives 64 possible patterns</strong>, each
            representing a different operation the ALU can perform. Which
            operations exist depends on how the ALU designer defines them.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you were an ALU designer, you could assign the pattern
            <strong>0x000011 (3)</strong> to multiplication. Then, every time
            the ALU sees that pattern, it knows to perform multiplication and
            uses logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) and a ripple-carry adder to get the
            result.
          </p>
          <p>
            So the ALU is always repeating this same cycle:
            <strong>opcode → function → output</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            You now know how an ALU works, so let's take a look at how building
            an ALU in Rust takes place.
          </p>
          <h2>Building an ALU in Rust</h2>
          <p>
            It all started with <strong>binary truth</strong> tables
            <strong>an amazing hands-on way to learn logic</strong> and how
            Boolean logic applies to binary numbers bit-by-bit.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got these ideas from a few resources, which you can find in the
            credentials section.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I learned <strong>binary addition</strong> and how it works at
            the gate level, using pure logic for <strong>Sum</strong> and
            <strong>Carry Out</strong>. I built a full 32-bit ripple-carry adder
            in Rust (starting with a half-adder).
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, I moved to <strong>binary subtraction</strong>, learned
            about <strong>Difference</strong> and
            <strong>Borrow/Carry Out</strong>, and built a 32-bit ripple-carry
            subtractor.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first, I thought that was enough — but then I realized: what is
            an ALU without <strong>multiplication and division</strong>?
          </p>
          <p>
            So I built <strong>bit shifters</strong> using loops, subtraction,
            and addition, and then used those to implement
            <strong>binary multiplication</strong> with
            <strong>AND, SHIFT, and ADD</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I built <strong>binary division</strong> using
            <strong>if...else, subtraction</strong>, and <strong>shift</strong>.
            With that, I completed the final
            <strong>arithmetic layer</strong> for this ALU.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once all mental models were
            <strong>built and tested in Rust</strong>, I combined them into a
            single Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), which uses:
          </p>
          <ul class="post-ul">
            <li>Opcode</li>
            <li>Transformer: Integer to Binary</li>
            <li>Arithmetic functions</li>
            <li>Transformer: Binary to Integer</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            With these two transformers, the ALU now works with integers as
            input and performs bit-by-bit arithmetic under the hood.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, that was the process of building an ALU in Rust. Here are the
            mental models I've gained.
          </p>
          <h2>The Mental Models I've Gained</h2>
          <p>
            The deepest mental model I've gained is that
            <strong>every program we write is like an ALU</strong> where the ALU
            is the parent function that takes an opcode and calls the right
            child function.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those functions then perform operations, sometimes working together.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like in any program, there is one main function (the parent)
            that controls the flow, while child functions do their tasks but
            cannot control the parent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another important lesson I learned is <strong>overflow</strong>,
            which happens when the final carry-out of an operation cannot fit
            inside its byte or word at the MSB. In Rust, this causes a
            <strong>runtime panic in debug mode</strong> or wraps around
            silently in release mode.
          </p>
          <p>
            This taught me why bit-width matters in arithmetic and why ALUs must
            handle overflow flags.
          </p>
