The world is changing **lightning fast**, but so can you. In today's blog, I'm going to walk you through a **step-by-step process** to **learn fast**, while also gaining a **deep understanding**.

Disclaimer: The way I learn is not shallow; information written in simplified form I use as little as possible, most often I look for fundamentals in specs, documentation, and books, to seek a fundamental understanding.

With that being said, let's dive into how it's done.

## How I leverage AI in my learning process

A lot of people are **scared that AI will replace their jobs**, while a **lot of jobs will indeed be replaced**, your intellect never will. And the better you become at understanding and **learning skills and knowledge**, the greater your intellect will grow. This also means that you can **add more value to society** in the coming age.

Here's how I use AI in my learning process, first I keep this **mental note**, AI has seen patterns accross many domains, better than we humans probably can. Some people ask, **'But what if AI is wrong?'** Well, **'what if the resource you're getting information from is wrong?'** Same question, different lens.

So, how do I use AI in my learning process? Lets give you an example, for example am interested in Blockchain, I want to be able to build blockchain with Rust, then **the question is how**, herefor I go to ChatGPT and ask 'what are the core fundamentals of Rust?' then it answers me by _giving the core fundamentals_ such as, Stack/Heap, Ownership, Borrowing, and the rest of the core fundamentals. After that, I ask, create a roadmap to learn these core fundamentals in the deepest way possible while only using resources such as **specs**, **documentation**, **books**, and **very deep blogs**.

Then I follow the roadmap of **core fundamentals**.

I have done this for multiple layers. To name a few, I built the **core fundamental** understanding of Rust 6 months ago, then I used those **core fundamentals** to build Hash Algorithms, such as SHA1/256/512, RIPEMD-160, MD4/5, and multiple other Hash Algorithms. If you want to take a look, you can [click here](https://github.com/Lmpkessels/cryptographic-algorithms).

Now you've understood how you can leverage AI in your learning process, let's take a look at the steps that I've organised.

## The step process in an organised manner.

<ol class="post-ul">
  <li>Define the goal</li>
  <li><b>Go to AI and ask</b>: "What are the core fundamentals I need to build a 1st principled foundation in {subject, skill, etc (use only one word)}".</li>
  <li>Ask it to build a roadmap for X amount of hours only using specs, documentations, and books (quick note: ask for the best chapters of the book, even better find a PDF of the book it just gave, then feed it to GPT and ask the question again: what are the best chapters of the book to build X understanding).</li>
  <li>Always <b>apply what you learn</b> as soon as possible, even if it breaks no matter what, put your ego aside and apply.</li>
  <li>Reflect on what you've applied. Here are <b>5 simple questions you can ask yourself</b>: (i) What did I work on? (ii) What broke before it was fixed? (iii) What did I learn from this work? (vi) What is the Why behind Closures? (iv) What is an area for improvement?</li>
</ol>

**Reminder**: Thanks to new technologies, we often get confused. To take a part of that away, keep asking, 'How does something make me better?' 'How will it improve society?' That makes you think of solutions.

Till the next one.
